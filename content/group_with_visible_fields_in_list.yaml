      title: "Soph Davenberry wins two prestigious South Seattle College Awards!"
      wysiwyg_basic: "<p>Hermanson&rsquo;s TAB Field Engineer, Soph Davenberry, will graduate this month with her Bachelor of Applied Science degree from the Sustainable Building Science Technology (SBST) program at South Seattle College. The combination of her dedication to her academics, the SBST program, and her collaboration with her fellow students has earned her two prestigious honors: the <strong>SBST Outstanding Student of the Year award</strong> and the <strong>President&rsquo;s Medal</strong>, awarded only to one Bachelor and one Transfer student each year.</p>\n<p><img style=\"max-width: 100%;\" title=\"Soph-Davenberry-Awards.jpg\" src=\"https://8w7nsf.media.zestyio.com/Soph-Davenberry-Awards.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;When I think of &lsquo;outstanding student,&rsquo; it was easy to call Soph Davenberry to mind. Not only is she outstanding academically, but she is a credit to her field and her community. Soph came from the sheet metal trades as an underrepresented person and excelled despite challenges. Specializing in testing, adjusting, and balancing HVAC systems (aka TAB), Soph has continued to advance professionally, even while in the program. Another characteristic that I particularly benefited from (as faculty) was her ability and willingness to help other students, whether that was to explain complicated concepts, assist with technical needs, or to provide quality feedback to other students' projects and ideas. Soph even led a session for the Sustainable Building Science Technology BAS program on testing, adjusting, and balancing HVAC systems. In addition, she often aligned her coursework to serve projects in her community, helping her local church improve the energy efficiency of its building as well as providing informed advice to the building committee about sustainable operations. Finally, one of the characteristics I appreciate most about Soph is her ability to understand systems-thinking, taking the long view and continuing to make connections between seemingly disparate ideas, a necessary skill in true sustainability work that is still somehow pretty rare,&rdquo; comments Alison Pugh, MBA, faculty member at South Seattle College &ndash; Georgetown Campus.</p>\n<p>The SBST program at South Seattle College prepares students to apply expertise and systems knowledge to support highly technical building operations.

Knowing this, a close friend of his encouraged him to join the trades to satisfy his love of fabricating and also make him some money in the process! It took a bit of coercing, but he eventually enrolled in a seven-year apprenticeship with the Local 32 Plumbers and Pipe Fitters Union. Upon graduation, he immediately started a fulfilling career in the trades working as a pipe fitter.</p>\n<p>Joshua has been a foreman with Hermanson for a few years now and has completed work at Good Samaritan Hospital, Boeing Renton, and the AMLI Arc, to name a few. His favorite project to date was the Auburn Central Utility Plant (CUP) job for MultiCare&rsquo;s Auburn Medical Center. This project was unique in that it was mainly a mechanical-only job site. &ldquo;Often times on a job like a high rise or hospital, you are working in a space with three or four other trades to keep construction on schedule. Auburn CUP was just one big mechanical room that we had to ourselves, with the exception of the electricians. Because of this, there were more opportunities to ask questions and learn as a team,&rdquo; says Joshua.</p>\n<p>Joshua is married to his wife of 11 years, Stacy, and has two children &ndash; Mac (22), and Maddison (15). Outside of work, you can find Joshua building, fixing, and riding any of his off-road vehicles &ndash; trucks, bikes, quads &ndash; you name it! He&rsquo;s the kind of guy that always has a project going, whether it&rsquo;s fixing up a truck or teaching his daughter to drive.</p>\n<p><strong>Thanks Joshua!</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td align=\"justify\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30%\">\n<p><img style=\"max-width: 100%;\" title=\"Joshua-Feldman-Sidebar1.jpg\" src=\"https://8w7nsf.media.zestyio.com/Joshua-Feldman-Sidebar1.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><img style=\"max-width: 100%;\" title=\"Joshua-Feldman-Sidebar2.jpg\" src=\"https://8w7nsf.media.zestyio.com/Joshua-Feldman-Sidebar2.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><img style=\"max-width: 100%;\" title=\"Joshua-Feldman-Sidebar3.jpg\" src=\"https://8w7nsf.media.zestyio.com/Joshua-Feldman-Sidebar3.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"

His formative years were spent in the Pacific Northwest, but at age 21, he moved south again to stay with his cousin who owns a plumbing shop. There, he was introduced to the trade and his cousin helped get him into the local union&rsquo;s apprenticeship program. After completing the 5-year curriculum, he moved back home to Renton, transferred to Local 32 and the rest is history!</p>\n<p>Dave has been one of Hermanson&rsquo;s leading plumbing and medical gas foremen for nine years. He started his career as a foreman focused primarily on plumbing &ndash; working on a variety of jobs from Safeco Field, to the Convention Center, to the courthouse and on to tenant improvement projects all over Seattle. In 1995, his focus shifted towards healthcare, where he found his passion for medical gas installations. His favorite job to-date was the Snoqualmie Valley Hospital project where he worked as a plumbing and medical gas foreman. In his own words, &ldquo;We had a great team out at the Snoqualmie job. We worked well together and the project itself allowed lots of room for creativity and problem-solving. I am really proud of the work we did out there.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Dave considers safety the most important part of his job. It is his responsibility to provide what everybody needs &ndash; tools, material, information &ndash; but at the end of the day, he wants to send his crew home to their families in the same condition they started in. In fact, one of the things he likes most about working at Hermanson is the focus on safety and the &lsquo;team&rsquo; core value. In his own words, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always felt that everyone at Hermanson has a genuine concern for me and my team. They are interested in me as a person, not just another body on the job.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Outside of work, Dave likes to go hiking with his wife Linda and their 5-year-old Australian Shepherd/Border Collie pup, Patch. Linda and Dave have been married for 32 years and have three grown children &ndash; Chrisha, Gillian, and Richard. Their son Richard also works in the trades as a concrete finisher. When they&rsquo;re not out hiking, Dave and Linda also like to ride Harley Davidson motorcycles.</p>\n<p><strong>Thanks Dave!</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td align=\"justify\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30%\">\n<p><img style=\"max-width: 100%;\" title=\"Dave-Curley---Sidebar1.jpg\" src=\"https://8w7nsf.media.zestyio.com/Dave-Curley---Sidebar1.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><img style=\"max-width: 100%;\" title=\"Dave-Curley---Sidebar2.jpg\" src=\"https://8w7nsf.media.zestyio.com/Dave-Curley---Sidebar2.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><img style=\"max-width: 100%;\" title=\"Dave-Curley---Sidebar3.jpg\" src=\"https://8w7nsf.media.zestyio.com/Dave-Curley---Sidebar3.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"

      wysiwyg_basic: "<p><strong>Last month, Hermanson invited Fighting Chance Seattle to the Tukwila Community Center to give a self-defense training course to the ladies from our women&rsquo;s group, Women of Hermanson (WOH). </strong></p>\n<p>The &ldquo;Designed for Survival&rdquo; program, taught by Fighting Chance Seattle&rsquo;s owner and head instructor, Jordan Giarratano, provided a mix of soft skills and hard skills with a focus on awareness, identifying unsafe situations, reacting immediately, and basic physical self-defense practices.</p>\n<p>The program began with Jordan explaining how to set boundaries and to simply say yes and conversely, how to say no (it&rsquo;s harder than you might think!). Once the basic self-defense principles were reviewed, the classroom tables and chairs were cleared away for the hands-on portion of training. This is when the fun began! The women donned boxing punch mitts and learned how to harness their power to punch and fight off an attacker. Overall, the women learned the value of embracing their fears, trusting their intuitions, and how to use their bodies as a weapon, should they ever need to defend themselves.</p>\n<p>For more information on Fighting Chance Seattle, please visit their website: <a href=\"http://www.fightingchanceseattle.com \">www.fightingchanceseattle.com </a></p>\n<p>The Women of Hermanson group, WOH (pronounced &ldquo;whoa!&rdquo;) was started in the summer of 2017 with the purpose of providing Hermanson&rsquo;s female employees with a network to interact with each other socially, empower each other professionally, and inspire the next generation of women in construction through networking, mentoring, and community service.</p>\n<p><img style=\"max-width: 100%;\" title=\"DSC_8368.jpg\" src=\"https://8w7nsf.media.zestyio.com/DSC_8368.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><img style=\"max-width: 100%;\" title=\"DSC_8375-Pano.HkyTSDFYG.jpg\" src=\"https://8w7nsf.media.zestyio.com/DSC_8375-Pano.HkyTSDFYG.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><img style=\"max-width: 100%;\" title=\"DSC_8385.jpg\" src=\"https://8w7nsf.media.zestyio.com/DSC_8385.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><img style=\"max-width: 100%;\" title=\"DSC_8402.jpg\" src=\"https://8w7nsf.media.zestyio.com/DSC_8402.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>"

Since joining Hermanson, Dave has completed a number of projects, but his favorite thus far involved rebuilding two chillers at Pier 66 in Seattle.

Upon graduation, he enrolled in trade school at UTI and served a 5-year apprenticeship at UA Local 32. He&rsquo;s enjoyed a fulfilling career ever since! &ldquo;I like the diversity that service offers. There are so many directions to go in and there is so much to learn.

Tatjana works for the Tahoma School District as an Art Specialist and together they have two children, Bryson (7) and Avery (5), plus their two cats Kiki and Max.

Every winter, he goes backcountry snowboarding via heli-skiing or cat-skiing in Canada! In his downtime, Jeremy spends time with his wife of 10 years, Helen and his two boys, Ashton (17) and Avery (6).</p>\n<p><strong>Thanks Jeremy!</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td align=\"justify\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30%\">\n<p><img style=\"max-width: 100%;\" title=\"Sidebar1---Jeremy-Morrison.jpg\" src=\"https://8w7nsf.media.zestyio.com/Sidebar1---Jeremy-Morrison.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><img style=\"max-width: 100%;\" title=\"Sidebar2---Jeremy-Morrison.jpg\" src=\"https://8w7nsf.media.zestyio.com/Sidebar2---Jeremy-Morrison.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"

That was ten years ago and Marcus has been a valuable member of the Hermanson family ever since!</p>\n<p>Marcus is currently working in Silverdale on the Harrison Hospital job as the project&rsquo;s sheet metal foreman. He enjoys the planning, coordinating and teamwork aspects of his job. According to Marcus, &ldquo;efficiency is key&rdquo; at work and getting the job done right and in the most efficient manner is his highest priority. Safety and productivity are what drives him on the job. One of his favorite aspects of working for Hermanson is the family vibe: &ldquo;Hermanson has treated me very well, so I strive to treat them well in return. The company is family driven and it always feels like my team and I are on the same track &ndash; we all have the same goals and values.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Outside of work, Marcus spends his time with his wife Monica, friends and 6-month-old golden retriever puppy, Fred.

They visited multiple job sites a day and Tony really enjoyed the freedom to move around and travel that the trade provided. After plumbing houses for about 11 years, Tony joined the union in 2000 and started working at Hermanson shortly after in 2005. </p>\n<p>Since joining Hermanson, Tony has made a name for himself as a hardworking, knowledgeable team member and a valuable asset to every project he&rsquo;s involved in. In 2016, Tony was presented with Mortenson&rsquo;s Subcontractor Star Award for his exceptional work on the AMLI Arc project. He voiced his concerns, presented solutions, and encouraged all those around him, facilitating a positive and productive culture on the project, which was a key contributing factor to the success of this highrise.</p>\n<p>To say Tony Landru is a dedicated man would be a great understatement. Not only is he devoted to his role as plumbing foreman at Hermanson, but he has also spent the last 17 years coaching his sons and local youth in hockey, football, and boxing &ndash; all full-time commitments! His younger son Zach was a two-time national boxing champion and was ranked number one in the United States in 2012, thanks to the strong work ethic and dedication that was instilled in him by his father. </p>\n<p>Whether he&rsquo;s on the job or coaching, Tony always follows the mantra, &lsquo;treat others how you&rsquo;d like to be treated.&rsquo; He strives to create a welcoming environment for the people around him and attributes his success to his positive attitude. He considers the most important part of his job to be training the next generation of men and women in the trades. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been lucky enough to work for some of the best tradesmen in the industry. I think that mentoring the next generation is key &ndash; we should be encouraging them to start careers in the trade and support them in their training however possible&rdquo; says Tony. </p>\n<p>Tony recently married his long-time partner, Ronda. Together, they have two sons, Wayne (28) &amp; Zachary (21), and two five-year-old teacup chihuahuas, Zayda and Tarra.

      wysiwyg_basic: "<p><strong>Hermanson&rsquo;s Tenant Improvement Group (TIG) does a lot of work within the City of Seattle. </strong></p>\n<p>You could throw a stone and be guaranteed to hit a Hermanson project! With the City&rsquo;s recent economic boom, we have been very fortunate to grow our workforce and presence as a company along with it. Seattle is a city full of opportunity and advancement but also has a large population of less fortunate individuals. Hermanson&rsquo;s core values center around earning trust, building relationships, and creating a sense of community: we pick each other up! So why not apply those same principles to the community that has helped us grow?</p>\n<p>This is why we chose to volunteer our time and resources with the Seattle Union Gospel Mission. The UGM is a men&rsquo;s homeless shelter that provides housing, basic needs and rehabilitation, and teaches transitional skills to help introduce those individuals back into society. Spearheaded by Andrea Smith and supported by Tyler Rogers, Hermanson&rsquo;s TIG team registered for the lunchtime Bring A Meal (BAM) program for April 4th. The Hermanson team participated in every stage of the event - from purchasing and loading up a truck with enough food to feed 400 people, to delivering and prepping the meal, cooking, serving lunch, and cleaning up. It was hard work and took a lot of people, but the looks of happiness and gratitude on the faces of those we served made it all well worthwhile! It was an outstanding event for an exceptional organization.</p>\n<p>Thank you to everyone who participated:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Andrea Smith</li>\n<li>Tyler Rogers</li>\n<li>Rick Hermanson</li>\n<li>Chris Gourley</li>\n<li>Jason Petterson</li>\n<li>Billy Langan</li>\n<li>Keola Fu</li>\n<li>David Norris</li>\n<li>Jason Heritage</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And a huge thank you to the Seattle Union Gospel Mission for being welcoming and accommodating.

Use of this technology achieves significant increases in field productivity.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the video, Vanessa sets up the Trimble by strapping a column clamp to a column. This clamp will keep the \"robot\" level and within sight of the &ldquo;prism,&rdquo; the endpoint for measurement. The large yellow laser is called a robotic total station (RTS) or robot for short. When Vanessa installs the robot onto the clamp, she will need to level the base for accurate readings.</p>\n<p>Then, Vanessa uses a layout rod with a prism attached to the top. The prism communicates with the robot to establish distance. Also attached to the rod is a tablet showing \"points\" that represent where hangers or sleeves need to be installed. When the layout rod is positioned correctly, the table will show a checkmark, signifying that it&rsquo;s time to mark the point. Vanessa uses a punch to mark where to install hangers and sleeves.</p>\n<p>Using Vanessa&rsquo;s punch, the plywood is marked with an identifying label. Different colors are used to identify which trade will use the mark and what kind of hanger or sleeve is needed. The team will hammer \"bangers\" into the plywood at the marked positions. Embedded in the middle of the banger is a thread that will later be used to install hangers.</p>\n<p><img style=\"max-width: 100%;\" title=\"DSC_4101.jpg\" src=\"https://8w7nsf.media.zestyio.com/DSC_4101.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><img style=\"max-width: 100%;\" title=\"DSC_4090.jpg\" src=\"https://8w7nsf.media.zestyio.com/DSC_4090.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Used in both new construction and major renovation, the precise work of Vanessa and her team is critical to the efficient mechanical system installation.</p>"
